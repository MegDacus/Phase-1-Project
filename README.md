# Phase-1-Project

Welcome to my Animal Adoption Page! 

To start:
The formSubmissionDB.json should be run on port 3000.
The animalDB.json should be run on port 3001.

You can access animals available for adoption by selecting the animal cards on the home page, or you can navigate using the links in the navigation bar at the top.

Upon opening the Available Dogs or Available Cats page, you can choose to adopt or enquire about each animal. 

When you adopt, you should get a congratulatory alert and the animal you've adopted will no longer be available for adoption. 
When you choose to enquire, you will be navigated to an enquiry form to be submitted. 

Each adopted animal's information will be pushed to the animalDB.json database. 
Each form submission will push the email and message to the formSubmissionDB.json.

Thanks for visiting!
